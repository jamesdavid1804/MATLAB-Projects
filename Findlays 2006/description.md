# Findlays 2006 Model - Deterministic and Stochastic Systems

Mathematical Models implemented on MATLAB based on the work in the Findlays 2006 paper in which describes a model of phytoplankton concentration over time based on initial concentration levels of nutrition and phytoplankton. The scripts include a deterministic model, stochastic model and plots showing a visual representation of the outcome.
