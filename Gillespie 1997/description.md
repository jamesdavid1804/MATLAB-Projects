# Gillespie 1997 - Mathematical Models
These scripts describe SIR models simulating an epidemic over time based on the work in the Gillespie 1997 paper - they have been implemented on MATLAB. These scripts include a deterministic system, a stochastic system and a script to visualise the results after the models have been run.
